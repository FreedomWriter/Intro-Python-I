# Print out 2 to the 65536 power
# (try doing the same thing in the JS console and see what it outputs)

# JS returns infinity (beecause JS technically doesn't have integers, it has 46 bit floats and anything larger than that results in integer overflow so `Infinity` is returned as a tangilble representation )

# YOUR CODE HERE

print(2**65536)
